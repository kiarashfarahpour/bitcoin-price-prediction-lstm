This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. By analyzing historical data of Bitcoin prices, the model attempts to forecast future prices based on patterns in the time-series data.

# Bitcoin Price Prediction using LSTM

This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. By analyzing historical data of Bitcoin prices, the model attempts to forecast future prices based on patterns in the time-series data.

## Features:
- Data collection from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance` API.
- Preprocessing of the data to normalize and split it into training and test datasets.
- LSTM model for time-series prediction.
- Visualization of predicted vs actual Bitcoin prices.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`)
- Scikit-learn

## Installation:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
